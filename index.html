            <div class="c2_item2">
                <p>Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more sense with what I thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that the result was just something nice and did not solve any problem.</p>

                <h3>Start with asking why</h3>
                <p>You will start seeing things differently and coming up with more effective ways of achieving goals.</p>

                <h3>Your ideas will have more value </h3>
                <p>By looking at problems from a different perspective, your ideas will be fresher and more valuable.</p>

                <h3>Design solutions with love </h3>

                <h3>Share and show your work </h3>
                <p>As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that‚Äôs not finished or doesn‚Äôt look perfect. You will learn to accept feedback and learn from it.</p>
